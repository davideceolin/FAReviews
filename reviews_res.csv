Now Ive been a huge Sketchers Go Walk fan for some time and the only reason I tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
These shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. I use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (I go through shoes fast enough that Ive recently consolidated).
If you're a Go Walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, HOWEVER, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
The material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. My feet do not feel hot in them.

They look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
With the exception of running (for which I use proper Mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
If I could, I'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - I have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so I do look for a good under the foot fit. I could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when I did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(
However, this is overall an awesome shoe that I will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). The shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look ""dirty"" easily. My previous pair of flex supreme TR 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out.

I haven't had a pair of Nikes since Nike shoxs came out. They are so much more lightweight than those. I wore them an entire day the first day and had no problems. The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row. I don't understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I'm sure that was the problem. I wore different shoes today and had no pain. I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.

**UPDATE: So, initially after wearing them, I had hip pain after wearing them.

Now Ive been a huge Sketchers Go Walk fan for some time and the only reason I tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
These shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. I use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (I go through shoes fast enough that Ive recently consolidated).
If you're a Go Walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, HOWEVER, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
The material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. My feet do not feel hot in them.

They are definitely a light-weight training shoe so I wouldn't get them if you are going to be doing a lot of running. But this also makes them extremely comfortable, I hadn't realized how hot running shoes made my feet until I switched to these.

They look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
With the exception of running (for which I use proper Mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
If I could, I'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - I have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so I do look for a good under the foot fit. I could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when I did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(
However, this is overall an awesome shoe that I will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). The shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look ""dirty"" easily. My previous pair of flex supreme TR 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out.

I haven't had a pair of Nikes since Nike shoxs came out. They are so much more lightweight than those. I wore them an entire day the first day and had no problems. The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row. I don't understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I'm sure that was the problem. I wore different shoes today and had no pain. I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.

**UPDATE: So, initially after wearing them, I had hip pain after wearing them.

Now Ive been a huge Sketchers Go Walk fan for some time and the only reason I tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
These shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. I use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (I go through shoes fast enough that Ive recently consolidated).
If you're a Go Walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, HOWEVER, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
The material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. My feet do not feel hot in them.

I was pleasantly surprised by the sole/tread on these for my circuit training classes, as I couldn't really tell by online pics.  Also pleasantly surprised that these ran ever so slightly bigger than Nike running shoes I use to wear 15+years ago - I always wore one to 1.5 sizes larger in their ""Hurache's""/running shoes, so I was really worried my size 6 would be too small - there is actually more toe room in these shoes than any other size 6 shoe I own (athletic, heel, boot).

They look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
With the exception of running (for which I use proper Mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
If I could, I'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - I have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so I do look for a good under the foot fit. I could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when I did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(
However, this is overall an awesome shoe that I will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). The shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look ""dirty"" easily. My previous pair of flex supreme TR 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out.

I tried these shoes on in the store before purchasing them on Amazon. They are very lightweight and comfortable. I was surprised how great they felt. I haven't had a pair of Nikes since Nike shoxs came out. They are so much more lightweight than those. I wore them an entire day the first day and had no problems. The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row. I don't understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I'm sure that was the problem. I wore different shoes today and had no pain. I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.

Now Ive been a huge Sketchers Go Walk fan for some time and the only reason I tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
These shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. I use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (I go through shoes fast enough that Ive recently consolidated).
If you're a Go Walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, HOWEVER, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.

They look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
With the exception of running (for which I use proper Mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
If I could, I'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - I have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so I do look for a good under the foot fit. I could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when I did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(

I haven't had a pair of Nikes since Nike shoxs came out. They are so much more lightweight than those. I wore them an entire day the first day and had no problems. The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row. I don't understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I'm sure that was the problem. I wore different shoes today and had no pain. I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.

Breathable, lightweight but sturdy, and comfortable during all my workouts. The built-in arch support is great and I've had no discomfort after 2 weeks of use. As far as the sole thickness and cushioning goes, I would consider these a 'medium' build (not thin, not overly thick) so if you're into heavy running outdoors then take that into consideration.

Now Ive been a huge Sketchers Go Walk fan for some time and the only reason I tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
These shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. I use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (I go through shoes fast enough that Ive recently consolidated).
If you're a Go Walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, HOWEVER, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
The material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. My feet do not feel hot in them.

I've been having feet problems while taking a gym class and I think they won't give me enough support when running.  they're great for wearing at home or gym and doing exercises in one place- extremely light weight and flexible, but i don't know if they'll last long if you use them everywhere else.  :(  i really like them but i cant just buy 2 different shoes.
also, i really like the strings inside the lining on the side of the shoes to adjust and make the shoe fit snug. it makes me feel secure :D",very comfortable but limited use,1479686400,,,"[('a size', 0.0874953013834985), ('gym', 0.08699194830877506), ('comfort', 0.0869134516827427), ('feet problems', 0.08621973314995125), ('wide flat feet', 0.08461676289730498), ('enough support', 0.07566354762915757), ('exercises', 0.0725619154223008), ('a gym class', 0.05811107737332167), ('2 different shoes', 0.05680959651297328), ('extremely light weight', 0.056194546025932254), ('DSW', 0.05220077586808431), ('home', 0.05153547157907953), ('the shoe', 0.047458183602407056), ('the shoes', 0.047458183602407056), ('one place-', 0.035790695905558764), ('their look', 0.030638109983102315), ('the side', 0.025433484596403502), ('the lining', 0.022450969313061706), ('a pair', 0.021283130100439307), ('the strings', 0.01981820749273398), ('2', 0.0), ('50$', 0.0), ('6.5', 0.0), ('7', 0.0), ('I', 0.0), ('i', 0.0), ('it', 0.0), ('me', 0.0), ('them', 0.0), ('they', 0.0), ('you', 0.0)]",93.25866666666668,undec

They look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
With the exception of running (for which I use proper Mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
If I could, I'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - I have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so I do look for a good under the foot fit. I could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when I did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(
However, this is overall an awesome shoe that I will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). The shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look ""dirty"" easily. My previous pair of flex supreme TR 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out.

I don't understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I'm sure that was the problem. I wore different shoes today and had no pain. I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.

**UPDATE: So, initially after wearing them, I had hip pain after wearing them. I don't know if they just needed to be broken in, but I wear them all the time now and have not experienced any pain since the first couple times of wearing them. They are comfortable, and I love them even more now.",Comfortable and lightweight,1462320000,20.0,,"[('hip pain', 0.13177670223497512), ('time', 0.11187856270181151), ('first', 0.09509584193945839), ('the first couple times', 0.08332210127243316), ('Nike shoxs', 0.07674888752018258), ('different shoes', 0.07376301382746919), ('Amazon', 0.06976430564832291), ('The second day', 0.06509410285453981), ('two days', 0.057997237835870276), ('Nike', 0.054730636426197576), ('a pain', 0.053202375536807005), ('any pain', 0.053202375536807005), ('no pain', 0.053202375536807005), ('the pain', 0.053202375536807005), ('today', 0.052883471006274725), ('people', 0.052662867141921865), ('normal wear', 0.04897405541959797), ('Nikes', 0.04831314068290225), ('no problems', 0.04394074933393849), ('the problem', 0.04394074933393849), ('an extended amount', 0.041494376890030715), ('the evening', 0.039105444230183466), ('my hip', 0.03656680267267886), ('my feet', 0.031854950851390944), ('these shoes', 0.030279349463797473), ('the rest', 0.02965038745142299), ('a row', 0.02835660357693022), ('the point', 0.026936932572537882), ('a recess aide', 0.025972415017052636), ('my daily routine', 0.025972415017052636), ('six hours', 0.02147159447275224), ('the store', 0.02051687340967207), ('a pair', 0.019698268477180203), ('*UPDATE', 0.015877671007930808), ('the way', 0.015877671007930808), ('I', 0.0), ('Nothing', 0.0), ('They', 0.0), ('it', 0.0), ('only 30', 0.0), ('that', 0.0), ('them', 0.0), ('they', 0.0), ('those', 0.0)]",87.03780219780222,undec

These shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. I use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (I go through shoes fast enough that Ive recently consolidated).
If you're a Go Walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, HOWEVER, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
The material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. My feet do not feel hot in them.

I was pleasantly surprised by the sole/tread on these for my circuit training classes, as I couldn't really tell by online pics.  Also pleasantly surprised that these ran ever so slightly bigger than Nike running shoes I use to wear 15+years ago - I always wore one to 1.5 sizes larger in their ""Hurache's""/running shoes, so I was really worried my size 6 would be too small - there is actually more toe room in these shoes than any other size 6 shoe I own (athletic, heel, boot).

They look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
With the exception of running (for which I use proper Mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
If I could, I'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - I have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so I do look for a good under the foot fit. I could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when I did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(
However, this is overall an awesome shoe that I will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). The shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look ""dirty"" easily. My previous pair of flex supreme TR 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out.

I tried these shoes on in the store before purchasing them on Amazon. They are very lightweight and comfortable. I was surprised how great they felt. I haven't had a pair of Nikes since Nike shoxs came out. They are so much more lightweight than those. I wore them an entire day the first day and had no problems. The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row. I don't understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I'm sure that was the problem. I wore different shoes today and had no pain. I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.

**UPDATE: So, initially after wearing them, I had hip pain after wearing them. I don't know if they just needed to be broken in, but I wear them all the time now and have not experienced any pain since the first couple times of wearing them.

Now Ive been a huge Sketchers Go Walk fan for some time and the only reason I tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
These shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. I use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (I go through shoes fast enough that Ive recently consolidated).
If you're a Go Walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, HOWEVER, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.

They look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
With the exception of running (for which I use proper Mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
If I could, I'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - I have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so I do look for a good under the foot fit. I could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when I did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(
However, this is overall an awesome shoe that I will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine).

I haven't had a pair of Nikes since Nike shoxs came out. They are so much more lightweight than those. I wore them an entire day the first day and had no problems. The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row. I don't understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I'm sure that was the problem. I wore different shoes today and had no pain. I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.

Now Ive been a huge Sketchers Go Walk fan for some time and the only reason I tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
These shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. I use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (I go through shoes fast enough that Ive recently consolidated).
If you're a Go Walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, HOWEVER, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
The material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. My feet do not feel hot in them.

I was pleasantly surprised by the sole/tread on these for my circuit training classes, as I couldn't really tell by online pics.  Also pleasantly surprised that these ran ever so slightly bigger than Nike running shoes I use to wear 15+years ago - I always wore one to 1.5 sizes larger in their ""Hurache's""/running shoes, so I was really worried my size 6 would be too small - there is actually more toe room in these shoes than any other size 6 shoe I own (athletic, heel, boot).

also, i really like the strings inside the lining on the side of the shoes to adjust and make the shoe fit snug. it makes me feel secure :D",very comfortable but limited use,1479686400,,,"[('a size', 0.0874953013834985), ('gym', 0.08699194830877506), ('comfort', 0.0869134516827427), ('feet problems', 0.08621973314995125), ('wide flat feet', 0.08461676289730498), ('enough support', 0.07566354762915757), ('exercises', 0.0725619154223008), ('a gym class', 0.05811107737332167), ('2 different shoes', 0.05680959651297328), ('extremely light weight', 0.056194546025932254), ('DSW', 0.05220077586808431), ('home', 0.05153547157907953), ('the shoe', 0.047458183602407056), ('the shoes', 0.047458183602407056), ('one place-', 0.035790695905558764), ('their look', 0.030638109983102315), ('the side', 0.025433484596403502), ('the lining', 0.022450969313061706), ('a pair', 0.021283130100439307), ('the strings', 0.01981820749273398), ('2', 0.0), ('50$', 0.0), ('6.5', 0.0), ('7', 0.0), ('I', 0.0), ('i', 0.0), ('it', 0.0), ('me', 0.0), ('them', 0.0), ('they', 0.0), ('you', 0.0)]",93.25866666666668,undec

They look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
With the exception of running (for which I use proper Mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
If I could, I'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - I have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so I do look for a good under the foot fit. I could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when I did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(
However, this is overall an awesome shoe that I will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). The shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look ""dirty"" easily. My previous pair of flex supreme TR 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out.

I tried these shoes on in the store before purchasing them on Amazon. They are very lightweight and comfortable. I was surprised how great they felt. I haven't had a pair of Nikes since Nike shoxs came out. They are so much more lightweight than those. I wore them an entire day the first day and had no problems. The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row. I don't understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I'm sure that was the problem. I wore different shoes today and had no pain. I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine.
